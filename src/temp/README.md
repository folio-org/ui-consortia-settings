# `temp` folder

This folder contains copied components from another module (`ui-users`) and is intended for temporary storage of duplicated code. Subsequently, it must be deleted after the required components have been moved to the shared source.

The folder stores the `<PermissionSetDetails>` and `<PermissionSetForm>` components and all their dependencies.
